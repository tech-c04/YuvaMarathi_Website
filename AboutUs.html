                Yuva Marathi (Marathi Literary Association) is a Literary and Cultural Club functioning under
                Office of Students' Welfare at Vellore Institute of Technology in Tamil Nadu.
                Having been established in 2016, we represent the magnificent culture and language of Maharashtra and
                pride on being a ‘Home away from Home’
                for all Marathi students. In spite of being founded in Tamil Nadu, we have 150+ enthusiastic members
                functioning in nine departments working
                towards the fulfillment of our motto – ‘To promote Marathi culture and provide a platform to the young
                girls and boys for showcasing their talents and skills.’
                Jay Maharashtra!
            </p>
